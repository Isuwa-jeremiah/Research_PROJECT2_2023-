This is the abstract:

Genes are essential biomarkers in determining biological conditions, including drug response and identifying diseases like brain, ovarian, and colon cancer. However, many of these genes are not directly associated with the target disease, leading to unnecessary difficulties during data analysis such as computational costs and poor learning performance. To address these issues, various techniques have been developed to select only a subset of relevant genes that aid in interpreting the target disease. Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms, such as Salp Swarm Optimization (SSA), have been successful in optimizing complex problems with a large search space, making them suitable for cancer gene datasets. To reduce the high dimensions of these datasets, hybridizing SI algorithms with filter methods for preliminary gene selection is crucial. Furthermore, this approach enhances the classification accuracy of the selected gene subset and minimizes the resources necessary for gene selection. This paper focuses on developing and investigating diverse ensemble microarray cancer gene selection approaches. We combined Chi-Square and Mutual Information filter methods with SSA in multiple singular and dual perspectives, utilizing colon and ovarian cancer datasets. Our findings show that Ensemble_4, which involves combining and re-ranking the top genes selected from each filter method and then passing them to SSA, significantly improves the performance accuracy of cancer gene selection across the datasets.
